          <h2>The Original MediumDesk</h2>
          <p>
            The first version of MediumDesk was developed as an open source software in 2016 when Medium.com was
            relatively new. It was one of the first projects to be built on Electron (developed by GitHub). More than
            3000 early adopters tried MediumDesk. The project currently lives in <a
            href="https://github.com/sivahq/mediumdesk">GitHub</a> and is not actively maintained.

            Today, more than 130 Million readers visit medium.com and it has become the standard way to share ideas.
            Electron has also matured significantly and many of the desktop apps we use today like Atom, VS Code, Slack,
            Figma, Wordpress.com are built using electron.

          <h2>New Improved MediumDesk v2.0</h2>
          <p>
            So we brought Medium and Electron together again to create a new improved experience that extends medium.com
            into desktops. We believe it is important for readers and writers to have a permanent place for Medium on
            their desktops.
